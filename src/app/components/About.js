            <p>For the past four decades we have been manufacturing knitwear for renowned European brands.</p>
            <p>
              There is something tactile and emotional about knitwear. We get attached to a sweater in ways that we donâ€™t always do with other
              clothing. Perhaps this is because there is something raw and organic about knitwear that brings us closer to the origin of clothing, by
              emphasizing textures and the yarns that are used to make it.
